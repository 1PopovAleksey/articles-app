# Project articles-app

The site was made in order to gain experience in developing with Vue, while I ran into many problems that I could deal with.

This project is a very simple news site, where using axios I make a request for a fake json, I also made the functions of deleting, viewing the article id, adding a new article, filtering by title or description, and real search. All the tasks assigned to me were implemented.

## How to run a project locally:
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
